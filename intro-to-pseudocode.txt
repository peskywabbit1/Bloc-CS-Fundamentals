Why do programmers use pseudocode?

It helps programmers to develop algorithms task by task. It is meant for humans to read and brainstorm before they begin to code the program. This is to read pseudocode allows the programmer and others to understand the intentions of the code.  


If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

If I run a pseudocode on my computer, nothing will happen.  The computer cannot read pseudocode.  


Programming Assignment:

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

FUNCTION NAME (INPUT first number,
INPUT second number)
IF first number is greater than second number
THEN PRINT the first number
ELSE PRINT second number

END FUNCTION

or 

FUNCTION numbers (array)
THEN 
FOR LOOP (var i=0; i < array.length; i++)
THEN

var greaterNumber = Math.max.apply{MATH, array[i]});

RETURN greaterNumber;


PRINT greaterNumber([[first number, second number]])

END FOR
END FUNCTION




2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

VAR numbers = NAME ARRAY (largest number)
POPULATE ARRAY 1- 100 With a 
FOR LOOP i<100 TRUE
THEN numbers [i] = i + 1

PRINT NUMBERS in array 1-100
FOR LOOP i < numbers.length  
PRINT numbers [i];


END FOR 
END FUNCTION


3.Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.


VAR phoneBook = ARRAY

FUNCTION phonebookSearch(entry)
FOR LOOP
IF entry == item
RETURN item
FUNCTION CALL('Dave')
END IF
END FOR
END FUNCTION



4.Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

let phoneBook = ["Sharon", "Tom", "Dave", "Lisa", "Kerry"];

let entry = "Dave"

function phoneBookSearch(entry) {
    for(var i=0; i < phoneBook.length; i++) {
        if(phoneBook[i] === entry )
 {
            console.log("Found " + entry + " at index " + i);
        }
    }
   console.log("The name " + entry + " was not found");
}

phoneBookSearch(entry);
